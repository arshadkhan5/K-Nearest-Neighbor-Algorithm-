# K-Nearest-Neighbor-Algorithm- (Fruit Detection)

The KNN algorithm assumes that similar things exist in close proximity. In other words, similar things are near to each other.
#### K indicates how many Nearest Neighbour we are going to consider 
#### The Distance between the K and the new point will be through two techniques 
###Encludian Distance 
###Manhaton Distance
